        or 8 minutes now?!?), “Learn the Basics of React in 10 minutes” posted on LinkedIn by 
        some other overly optimistic dude, to less aggressive ones like “Learn React in 1 Hour” 
        published on Udemy and Learn React in an Afternoon or Two — this last one nearly getting it right.
